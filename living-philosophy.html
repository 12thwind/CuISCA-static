									<!-- Seasonal Living Section -->
										<h2 id="seasonal">Seasonal Living in the North</h2>
										
										<p>The Keweenaw's northern latitude creates distinct seasonal rhythms quite different from more temperate regions. Living well here involves developing a relationship with these cycles—learning to flow with them rather than resisting their particular challenges and gifts.</p>
										
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-3 col-6-medium col-12-small">
												<h3>Winter<br><span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">November-March</span></h3>
												<p>The season of rest and reflection. A time to honor darkness, cultivate inner warmth, and find beauty in stillness. The Keweenaw's snow-draped landscapes invite a special quality of presence.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-3 col-6-medium col-12-small">
												<h3>Spring<br><span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">April-May</span></h3>
												<p>The awakening time. Waters flow, ice breaks, and the first green emerges. A season of patience and anticipation as the Keweenaw gradually thaws and renews itself.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-3 col-6-medium col-12-small">
												<h3>Summer<br><span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">June-August</span></h3>
												<p>The season of fullness and light. Long days invite expanded activity, connection with water, and celebration of the peninsula's abundant beauty—ideal for wedding ceremonies.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-3 col-6-medium col-12-small">
												<h3>Autumn<br><span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">September-October</span></h3>
												<p>The harvest time. Brilliant colors transform the landscape as nature prepares for winter's rest. A season for gratitude, completion, and preparing for the inward turn.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										
										<div class="box alt">
											<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
												<div class="col-4">
													<p>Winter invites us to slow down, turn inward, and cultivate patience. Many find this the most challenging season, yet it offers profound gifts when embraced rather than merely endured.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="col-4">
													<p>Spring in the Keweenaw arrives gradually, with dramatic ice breakups, thundering waterfalls, and the gradual emergence of green. This season teaches us about transition and renewal.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="col-4">
													<p>Summer brings a burst of activity and abundance, with long days perfect for exploring Lake Superior's shores, forest trails, and the vibrant natural communities of the peninsula.</p>
												</div>
											</div>
										</div>
										
										<p>Our approach to seasonal living includes resources for aligning daily rhythms, nutrition, energy use, and spiritual practice with these natural cycles. Through individual guidance, we help you develop a personal relationship with Keweenaw's seasons that supports wellbeing and deeper connection with place.</p>
										
										<hr class="major" />

									<!-- Personal Practices Section -->
										<h2 id="practices">Personal Practices</h2>
										
										<p>We offer guidance for personal practices that help individuals develop deeper connection with themselves and the Keweenaw landscape:</p>
										
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Meditation & Presence</h3>
												<p>Developing awareness through regular mindfulness practices helps us notice the subtle shifts in ourselves and our environment. We can provide resources for meditation approaches particularly suited to the Keweenaw's distinctive natural settings—from shoreline practices to forest awareness to seasonal attunement.</p>
												
												
												<p>Our approach emphasizes accessible practices that integrate with daily life rather than requiring extensive retreat time. Whether you're new to meditation or have an established practice, we can offer guidance for deepening presence in this particular landscape.</p>
												
												<p>Resources include guided recordings specific to Keweenaw locations, written practices for different seasons, and individual consultations to develop a practice aligned with your unique circumstances.</p>
											</div>
											
											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Nature Connection</h3>
												<p>The Keweenaw offers extraordinary opportunities for deepening relationship with the natural world. We can suggest practices for developing sensory awareness, ecological knowledge, and contemplative connection with specific landscapes throughout the peninsula—helping you find your own meaningful places of power and presence.</p>
												
												
												<p>Our guidance draws from both ancient wisdom traditions and contemporary ecological understanding, offering a blend of practical knowledge about the Keweenaw's ecosystems and contemplative approaches to relating with these living communities.</p>
												
												<p>Resources include location guides for personally meaningful exploration, seasonal nature connection practices, and guidance for developing relationship with particular places over time.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Sacred Movement</h3>
												<p>Honoring the body as a vessel of wisdom through contemplative movement practices. We can provide guidance for adapting practices like gentle yoga, qigong, or authentic movement to different physical abilities and Keweenaw settings, emphasizing internal experience over external form.</p>
												
												<p>Our approach to movement emphasizes connection with the elements of the Keweenaw—practices that dialog with water, stone, forest, and seasonal energies. These can be particularly powerful when practiced at specific locations throughout the peninsula.</p>
												
												<p>Resources include location-specific movement practices, seasonal movement sequences, and guidance for developing your own embodied relationship with particular landscapes.</p>
											</div>
											
											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Personal Ceremonies</h3>
												<p>Beyond our wedding officiant services, we can offer guidance for creating personal ceremonies to mark significant transitions or deepen connection with place. These might include private land blessings, personal seasonal rituals, or marking life thresholds with intimate ceremonies.</p>
												
												<p>Our approach to personal ceremony emphasizes authenticity over formula, helping you develop meaningful symbolic actions and language that reflect your unique relationship with what you hold sacred. These personal practices can be powerful ways to integrate transition or deepen commitment.</p>
												
												<p>Resources include ceremonial frameworks that can be adapted to various purposes, guidance for working with elements and symbolic objects, and consultation for creating ceremonies for specific transitions.</p>

										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">

											</div>

												<h3>Food & Sustenance</h3>
												<p>Developing a mindful relationship with local food systems, seasonal eating patterns, and traditional preservation methods suited to the Keweenaw's growing season and climate.</p>

											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Work & Creation</h3>
												<p>Bringing presence and sacred relationship to professional and creative endeavors, particularly for those whose work involves direct relationship with the Keweenaw landscape.</p>
