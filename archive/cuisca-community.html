										<h1>Community Practices</h1>
									</header>
									
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/community-banner.jpg" alt="Community circle gathering" /></span>
									
									<p>At CuISCA, we believe that spiritual growth flourishes in community. While individual practice forms an essential foundation, gathering with others creates a container for deeper exploration, mutual support, and collective wisdom. Our community practices offer accessible entry points for people at all stages of their spiritual journey, regardless of background or prior experience.</p>

									<p>Each gathering is designed to balance structure with spontaneity, ancient wisdom with contemporary relevance, and individual experience with collective resonance. Our practices honor the rhythms of nature, the wisdom of the body, and the unique gifts that each participant brings to the circle.</p>
									
									<p>All are welcome to participate in these offerings. While some gatherings request a suggested donation to support our work, no one is turned away for lack of funds, and many events are freely offered.</p>

									<div class="box">
										<h3>Our Gathering Approach</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Circle Format</strong> - Most gatherings use a circle structure where each person is equally valued</li>
											<li><strong>Participatory Culture</strong> - We encourage active engagement rather than passive consumption</li>
											<li><strong>Nature Connection</strong> - Many gatherings take place outdoors or incorporate natural elements</li>
											<li><strong>Inclusive Language</strong> - We use language that welcomes diverse spiritual perspectives</li>
											<li><strong>Body Wisdom</strong> - We honor the body as a source of knowledge and intuition</li>
											<li><strong>Both/And Thinking</strong> - We embrace paradox and multiple ways of knowing</li>
											<li><strong>Seasonal Awareness</strong> - Our gathering rhythm follows natural cycles and seasonal shifts</li>
										</ul>

									<!-- Regular Practices Section -->
										<h2 id="practices">Regular Practices</h2>
										
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Meditation Circle</h3>
												<p>Our weekly meditation gatherings offer space for both guided and silent practice in community. Each session includes gentle movement to prepare the body, a variety of meditation techniques drawn from diverse traditions, and opportunity for reflection and integration.</p>
												
												<p>Beginners are warmly welcomed and given clear guidance, while experienced practitioners find depth and new perspectives. The circle format allows for both structure and organic responsiveness to what emerges in the moment.</p>
												
												<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday evenings, 7:00-8:30pm<br>
												<strong>Where:</strong> Sacred Circle Center (indoor) during winter months; various outdoor locations during warmer seasons<br>
												<strong>Offering:</strong> Suggested donation $5-15, no one turned away</p>
											</div>
											
											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
												<h3>New & Full Moon Gatherings</h3>
												<p>Following the lunar cycle, these bi-monthly gatherings create space for intention-setting (new moon) and celebration/gratitude (full moon). Each gathering includes ceremony, reflection practices, and community connection, with themes that respond to seasonal energies and collective needs.</p>
												
												<p>New moon gatherings tend toward quieter introspection and visioning, while full moon gatherings embrace more expressive celebration. Both honor the cyclical nature of all things and our relationship with celestial rhythms.</p>
												
												<p><strong>When:</strong> New and Full Moons, typically evenings<br>
												<strong>Where:</strong> Varies by season—beaches, forests, or indoor spaces<br>
												<strong>Offering:</strong> Freely given; contributions to community meal welcome</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Nature Connection Experiences</h3>
												<p>These guided immersion experiences help participants deepen their relationship with the natural world through sensory awareness, naturalist knowledge, and contemplative practices. Each experience focuses on a particular landscape (forest, shoreline, wetland) or theme (bird language, plant relationships, seasonal transitions).</p>
												
												<p>Led by skilled facilitators with extensive ecological knowledge and nature connection experience, these offerings balance science with spiritual awareness, creating a holistic approach to environmental relationship.</p>
												
												<p><strong>When:</strong> Monthly, typically weekend mornings<br>
												<strong>Where:</strong> Various natural areas throughout the Keweenaw<br>
												<strong>Offering:</strong> Sliding scale $15-30, scholarships available</p>
											</div>
											
											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Sacred Movement</h3>
												<p>Honoring the body as a vessel of wisdom, these gatherings explore contemplative movement practices from various traditions. Sessions might include gentle yoga, qigong, authentic movement, ecstatic dance, or other somatic practices that foster embodied awareness.</p>
												
												<p>All movement offerings are adaptable to different physical abilities and emphasize internal experience over external form. No prior movement experience is necessary, and each gathering includes guidance for modifications to suit individual needs.</p>
												
												<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday mornings, 7:00-8:15am<br>
												<strong>Where:</strong> Sacred Circle Center or beach/forest locations in summer<br>
												<strong>Offering:</strong> Suggested donation $5-15, no one turned away</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Community Potluck & Council</h3>
												<p>These monthly gatherings combine the nourishment of shared food with the practice of council—a structured form of compassionate communication where each person has the opportunity to speak and be heard from the heart. Each council has a theme or focusing question that invites authentic sharing.</p>
												
												<p>The combination of breaking bread together and intentional dialogue creates a foundation for meaningful community connection that extends beyond spiritual practice into everyday relationship.</p>
												
												<p><strong>When:</strong> First Friday of each month, 6:00-9:00pm<br>
												<strong>Where:</strong> Sacred Circle Center<br>
												<strong>Offering:</strong> Bring a dish to share</p>
											</div>
											
											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Study & Practice Groups</h3>
												<p>These time-limited groups (typically 4-8 weeks) explore specific spiritual texts, practices, or themes in greater depth. Past topics have included dreamwork, contemplative writing, grief tending, traditional crafts as spiritual practice, and exploring cross-cultural wisdom traditions.</p>
												
												<p>Groups combine intellectual exploration with experiential practice, personal reflection with group dialogue. Each group is co-created by participants, with facilitation that encourages shared ownership of the learning journey.</p>
												
												<p><strong>When:</strong> Varies by group, typically weekday evenings<br>
												<strong>Where:</strong> Sacred Circle Center or members' homes<br>
												<strong>Offering:</strong> Varies by group; materials fee sometimes applies</p>

										<p>Following our principle of Cyclical Wisdom, we gather eight times throughout the year to mark the solar cycle—solstices, equinoxes, and the midpoints between them.
