										<h2>Who We Are</h2>
									</header>
									<p>CuISCA was founded on the shores of Copper Island with a simple but powerful vision: communities can protect and support each other without resorting to violence. We are a network of trained community members dedicated to building resilience, fostering dialogue, and providing alternatives to militarized security approaches.</p>
									
									<p>Our organization brings together people from all walks of life—teachers, craftspeople, healthcare workers, students, and retirees—united by a commitment to nonviolent principles and community sovereignty. What began as a small local initiative has grown into a regional movement, demonstrating that security through solidarity is not just an ideal, but a practical reality.</p>

										<h2>Our Approach</h2>
									</header>
									<p>At CuISCA, we recognize that lasting security cannot be imposed from outside or achieved through force. Instead, we work alongside communities, respecting their wisdom and autonomy while offering tools, training, and support.</p>
									
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Proactive rather than reactive</h3>
											<p>We believe in building strong foundations rather than waiting for crises to occur.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Locally rooted but widely connected</h3>
											<p>Each CuISCA chapter reflects its local context while drawing strength from our broader network.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Practical yet principled</h3>
											<p>We combine idealism with pragmatism, offering concrete alternatives to violent security paradigms.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Trauma-informed and healing-centered</h3>
											<p>We recognize that building true security requires addressing past harms and supporting collective healing.</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									
									<div class="box">
										<h3>Our Impact</h3>
										<p>Since our founding, CuISCA has:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Trained over 500 community members in nonviolent protection strategies</li>
											<li>Supported 12 communities through various crises without a single incident of escalated violence</li>
											<li>Facilitated 30+ successful community dialogue processes addressing deep-rooted conflicts</li>
											<li>Established sustainable mutual aid networks that continue to function independently</li>
											<li>Demonstrated viable alternatives to traditional security structures in both rural and urban contexts</li>
										</ul>
										<p>But statistics tell only part of the story. Our true impact lies in transformed relationships, strengthened communities, and the gradual shift toward a culture that values cooperation over domination.</p>
									</div>
									
									<blockquote>"When I established CuISCA, many called it idealistic to imagine communities keeping each other safe without weapons or force. Years later, we've shown it's not only possible but more effective. True security comes not from fear or dominance, but from connection and care. Each day, I witness ordinary people doing extraordinary things simply by choosing another path—one of patience, understanding, and unfailing commitment to each other's dignity. This is the foundation of everything we build."<br><br>— Ronan Byrne, Founder</blockquote>
