												<h2>Our Founder</h2>
											</header>
											<p>Ronan Byrne established CuISCA after witnessing the escalating cycle of division and inequality in modern society. A technical writer by profession with expertise in traditional manufacturing equipment, Ronan brings a thoughtful, deliberate approach to the organization's philosophy and structure.</p>
											<p>Living remotely on Copper Island, Ronan developed CuISCA's core principles by combining his humanitarian ideals with practical knowledge of self-sufficiency and community resilience. His background in traditional craftsmanship influenced our focus on sustainable, grassroots approaches to community wellbeing and conflict resolution.</p>
											<p>Despite his preference for solitude, Ronan's commitment to community support and resilience has drawn together like-minded individuals seeking alternatives to militarized solutions. He leads by example, demonstrating that true security comes not from force but from building strong, interconnected communities.</p>
