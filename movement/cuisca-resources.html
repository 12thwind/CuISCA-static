										<h1>Keweenaw Resources</h1>
									</header>
									<p>The Keweenaw Peninsula is a special place with a rich history and unique character.

										<h2 id="content">The Keweenaw Peninsula</h2>
										<p>Often called "Copper Island," the Keweenaw Peninsula extends into Lake Superior and was once home to one of the largest copper mining booms in American history. Today, it's known for its stunning natural beauty, historic sites, vibrant communities, and a culture of resilience and independence that has characterized the region for generations.</p>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Geography & Climate</h3>
												<p>The Keweenaw Peninsula is the northernmost part of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, jutting into Lake Superior. Its unique geography creates distinct microclimates, including the famous "lake effect" that brings record snowfall each winter (often exceeding 200 inches annually). The region features rugged cliffs, dense forests, pristine beaches, and numerous inland lakes and streams, making it a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts year-round.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Cultural Heritage</h3>
												<p>Rich in both Indigenous and immigrant history, the Keweenaw's cultural landscape reflects the legacy of the Ojibwe people, followed by waves of European immigrants who came to work the copper mines. Finnish, Cornish, Croatian, Italian, and many other cultures have left their mark on regional cuisine, architecture, music, and community traditions that continue to this day through festivals, art, and local practices.</p>

												<h3>Seasonal Highlights</h3>
												<dl>
													<dt>Winter (November-April)</dt>
													<dd>
														<p>World-class snowfall creates opportunities for downhill skiing at Mount Bohemia and Mont Ripley, extensive cross-country ski trails at Swedetown and Michigan Tech trails, snowshoeing through silent forests, and ice formations along Lake Superior shores. The annual Winter Carnival features elaborate snow sculptures.</p>
													</dd>
													<dt>Spring (May-June)</dt>
													<dd>
														<p>Waterfalls reach peak flow as snow melts, trilliums and wildflowers carpet the forest floors, and migratory birds return. Spring is also brook trout season and a peaceful time to explore with fewer visitors.</p>
													</dd>
													<dt>Summer (July-August)</dt>
													<dd>
														<p>Beaches along Lake Superior offer refreshing (though always brisk) swimming, hiking trails showcase lush greenery, and long daylight hours allow for extended exploration. Art fairs, music festivals, and farmers markets fill the calendar.</p>
													</dd>
													<dt>Fall (September-October)</dt>
													<dd>
														<p>Spectacular foliage transforms the peninsula into a mosaic of reds, oranges, and golds. The Brockway Mountain Drive offers panoramic views, apple orchards open for picking, and the diminishing crowds allow for solitude on trails and beaches.</p>
