										<h2>Your Keweenaw Wedding Ceremony Guide</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Welcome to a space of intention and presence. At CuISCA, we're dedicated to creating ceremonies that transcend the ordinary, honoring the sacred commitment you're making amid the powerful landscapes of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula. From the ancient shores of Lake Superior to the timeless copper country venues, we help couples craft ceremonies that reflect the depth and authenticity of their unique journey together.</p>
									
									<p>As your ceremony guide, we create a container for meaningful moments that resonate with your authentic selves. We honor all spiritual paths, personal beliefs, and cultural traditions, weaving them thoughtfully into ceremonies that feel true to your essence as individuals and as a couple.</p>
									
									<p>We come to you wherever you choose to mark this threshold moment—whether it's beneath ancient trees, beside healing waters, on family land rich with history, or in a space that simply speaks to your hearts. The Keweenaw Peninsula offers countless sacred settings, and we're honored to help create a ceremony that connects deeply with both you and the land where you choose to exchange your vows.</p>

										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Sacred Preparation</h3>
											<p>We begin with a heart-centered conversation about your relationship, values, and vision for your ceremony. This is more than planning—it's a ritual of intention-setting that helps clarify what matters most to you. We'll craft a ceremony framework that resonates with your authentic selves, revising thoughtfully until it feels aligned with your deepest intentions.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>The Threshold Moment</h3>
											<p>On your ceremony day, we arrive early to ground ourselves in your chosen space, connecting with the energy of the land and the moment. We create a container of presence and reverence as we guide you and your witnesses through this meaningful transition. The ceremony becomes a bridge between your past and future, held with care and authenticity.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Integration</h3>
											<p>After your ceremony, we attend to the practical aspects of filing your marriage license with mindful attention, ensuring this legal recognition is completed with the same care as your ceremony. We also provide you with a keepsake copy of your ceremony text as a touchstone for reflection throughout your journey together.</p>
